# Welcome to my Digital Garden ðŸŒ±

This is where ideas grow and connect. Unlike traditional blog posts that are polished and finished, notes in a digital garden are living documents that evolve over time.

## What you'll find here

- **Evolving thoughts** on design, technology, and life
- **Connected ideas** using [[wikilinks]] to reference other notes
- **Works in progress** that get better over time
- **Random musings** that don't fit elsewhere

## How it works

This garden is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and supports:

- **Wikilinks**: Use `[[Note Name]]` to link to other notes
- **Tags**: Organize content by topic
- **Timestamps**: Track when notes are created and updated

Feel free to wander and explore. The best gardens are discovered, not just read.
