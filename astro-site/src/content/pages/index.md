## Uncovering strategy:

My background is in User Experience Design, which deeply informs how I engage. I use a human centric set of tools and methods to bridge gaps between end users and team responsible for the product. My [experience](/resume) is comprised of design roles with a growing focus on product direction, strategy, and validation.

### Human centered research

I conduct structured conversations that build understanding of user's true needs, tasks, and environments. I create programs to activate the current customer base to prioritize needs, solve individual problems, and build retention.

### Engagement and communications

Excellent products are made with shared vision. I use internal communications, presentations, and workshops to vet our concepts and build consensus on our execution strategy.

### Quantitative data

Marrying together quantitative signals with qualitative framing allows us to size effects and verify critical needs. I collect, structure, and humanize data to make it actionable and useful instead of merely pulling metrics.

### Work cycles

Large products don't often get the luxury of building out the full feature set we want for each release. I find solutions that work in layers, achieving MVP while preparing for future improvements.

## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:

I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time reading the whole internet, playing music, creating, fixing things, building things, DIWhy-ing, playing games, and running all over. My wife and I live with our two daughters and a rabbit named Poptart in the woods of central Maryland.
