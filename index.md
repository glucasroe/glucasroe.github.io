## Design Lead. All Purpose Nerd.

I'm Lucas Roe (I also go by Luck). I use a broad range of methodologies to find and prioritize the path forward for excellent products.

## Uncovering strategy:
My background is in User Experience Design, which deeply informs how I engage. I use this toolbox to bridge gaps between end users and team responsible for the product.

### Human centered research
Structured conversations that build understanding of users true needs, tasks, and environments. I create programs to activate the current customer base to prioritize needs, solve individual problems, and build retention.

### Engagement and communications


### Quantitative data
Marrying together quantitative signals with qualitative framing affords effect sizing and verifies critical needs. I collect, structure, and humanize data to make it actionable and useful, not just pushing metrics.

### Work cycles
Large amounts of work



## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:
I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time reading the whole internet, playing music, creating, fixing things, building things, DIWhy-ing, playing games, and running all over. My wife and I live with our daughters and a rabbit (Poptart) in the woods of central Maryland in a log cabin dated to 1850's.
