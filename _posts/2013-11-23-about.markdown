I don't go by G, surprisingly. 

I'm Lucas, a designer and technologist from Baltimore.

<aside>This is what my face looks like. The goofy look is because I was having a hard time pushing the shutter button on my camera with a paintbrush handle. My wife told me it's endearing.</aside>

## <a name="professionally"></a>Professionally:
I try to be as broad as possible. I went to school for Design while working as a Front End Developer, and jumped right into UX directly after graduating.

I currently work at ACGI Software in Columbia as their UX Team of One. We make association management software. I work at a standing desk by typing on a mechanical keyboard, and you probably don't want to ask me about it.

## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:
The nerd life chose me. I'm a polymath in training, so I spend a lot of time cooking, pianoing, practicing calligraphy, reading the whole internet, gaming, and forming strong opinions. I'm married to a wonderful OT named Katie, and a pet rat named Ellie *(Yes, a rat. She's wonderful. Yes, her tail is gross. No, I don't want to touch a city rat.)*

I'm have a penchant for raw materials, especially wood and leather. Vacations are typically to the mountains or the ocean or a place with rollercoasters. I dance enthusiastically but with questionable ability. I'm really trying to be a morning person.

Also, if you want an earful, ask me at any time what game I'm playing. I'll probably have a spreadsheet to show you. (Right now it's Hearthstone)

## <a name="contact"></a> Contact:
