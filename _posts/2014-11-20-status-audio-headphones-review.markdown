Being a musician, I tend to have pretty high requirements for my headphones. I had been looking for a pair of circumaural headphones because I found myself getting sensitive to earbuds after having them in during extended work periods. After some searching, I stumbled upon Status Audio's website while they were in the preorder phase.

There wasn't a lot of information about the headphones except for a few [glorified](http://the-gadgeteer.com/2014/01/31/champagne-headphones-on-a-beer-budget/) [press](http://www.thesoundsensei.com/2014/02/03/anti-branding-headphones-status-audio/) [releases](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/01/prweb11536298.htm). Having backed a few Kickstarters, I was game to take a chance on preordering when it opened back in May.

The process was not the smoothest (I bitched about it a bit on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GLucasRoe/status/474987701570396160)), but I got my headphones by mid June.

## Physical Design
The first view of the packaging was underwhelming, but I had to remind myself, budget brand! The headphones and their components were all wrapped in plastic baggies inside of the box. With the sleeve and other packing efforts, I was surprised to see the components tossed in with so little care. It was a mildly sour end to the unpacking.

The build quality isn't fantastic. The matte finish is very nice, but it ends up highlighting when the seams don't come together well. You can also see in the photo below a small semicircular mark on the outside of the headset. This is from the cup of the one ear pressing on it, and leaving... well, leaving ear oils on the matte finish. It doesn't come off easily, or at all as far as I can tell.

The extension mechanism that makes them fit on my gargantuan head is by far the cheapest feeling part of the headset, it's brittle and looks as if it came from a 3D printer. The ear cups feel very nice which was surprising to me, I'm very glad that Status paid attention to this part in particular, since it's what you're on contact with.

One of the big things that Status used as their initial selling point was their "best cable in the game." The cable isn't bad, but saying it's a grand improvement over anything else is a huge stretch. It's a reasonable length, but not particularly long. The controls on it are nice, but they aren't anything outside of the ordinary 3 buttons you would expect to see on headphones with a volume control and a mic.

That being said, I do use them for phone calls on a pretty regular basis, and they do a great job at picking up my voice and helping me isolate the sound from my callers. At the very least, it's a nice headset.

Here's some photos of the headphones on my head. I don't have the ability to take myself seriously when taking selfies, so forgive the dumb faces. Note, I have a large head.

It's worth noting that the cups don't entirely cover my ears, so I can't wear the headphones for much long than maybe 2 hours because it makes the cartilege tender.

## Sound Quality
I don't have any complaints about the sound quality. My coworker has a pair of lovely Sennheiser Momentum, and I would regard the sound from these as only a step or two below that. Basses are rich but not overpowering. There seems to be a lot of clarity in highs and mids without being too shrill. It can struggle with highly textured pieces, if there's a ton going on it loses articulation. Considering the price point I would rate it extremely highly.

They have no active noice cancelling, but they do a reasonably good job at passive cancellation. They don't completely cover my ears though, so I have the impression that some sound still leaks through. If you're looking to be completely isolated, these probably aren't for you.

# Overall:
Personally, I wouldn't buy these again. They certainly have nice sound quality, but the discomfort and some of the cheap construction makes me feel like they won't stick around for more than maybe a year. They're great for starter headphones, (Which is what I was looking for) and to balance some audiophilic tendencies with a budget. The details of the design and execution end up revealing  cheapness, and it doesn't end up gelling as a longetive or sustainable product.

# Update: January 8, 2015
A few new details that are relevant since I published this back in November

## Boom.
I opened my desk drawer in December to find that the cable had somehow exploded apart without provocation.

Nice. The two halves are held together with plastic pins, and apparently the cable had been rolled under something by my opening the desk drawer, causing the pins to pull apart or snap. It still holds together and works, but I now have to smoosh it back together every few days as it starts to come apart. Not the greatest build quality.

Apparently they don't ship with this cable anymore as [MrXiro pointed out in the comments](http://glucasroe.com/status-audio-headphones-review/#comment-1775155349). It looks better built and hopefully is a little longer too.

## Comfort
I've become more acclimated to wearing the headphones for long periods and they don't hurt my poor tender ears as much. This is partially because I've been doing a lot more one earing (One cup on left ear, one cup behind my right ear.)
