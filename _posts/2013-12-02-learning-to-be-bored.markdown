### Designer Post college doldrums

My cone cells are withering. My monitor could be changed to monochrome and I might not even notice. My brain is starting to think in rectangles.

I have been at my current job as a Wireframer for 5 months, and in that time I have been monogamous with a tool called Axure. The program is scrappy and idiosyncratic in the way that only smaller products can be. I am fiercely loyal to it. I am forgetting where to find things in InDesign. My brain is being assimilated.

Colors? Forget colors. Shades of grey only. (50 is too many, can we limit it to about 7?) I have a wide range of font options though, I use Arial. Not Arial Black or Arial Narrow, those are too exotic. Vanilla Arial. If I’m feeling adventurous, I may bold and italicize things.

I do not use photos. I do not create illustrations. I rarely branch outside of boxes with rounded corners. It is fully, plainly, unequivocally boring, and it is the best thing to happen to my work so far.

## College doesn’t teach you to be bored.
I learned an amazing amount in college from fantastic mentors and teachers. Nobody taught me how to be bored. Taking multiple classes simultaneously gives you an astonishing breadth of creative, idea centric opportunities. You create on a daily basis. For most design professionals that is an absurd utopia. We work inside of constraints in the form of clients, coworkers, time, and tools. We do things that we dislike frequently. Our concept matters tremendously, but it recedes behind practicality. We are creators but not always artists.

Five months ago, I brought my first wireframe to my creative director. It was in greyscale, it only used Arial, and it was almost a complete parrot of her pen sketches. It was also terrible. She begins scribbling on the pages with a pen.

> We need to balance this more. Your type is all over the place and we need better hierarchy. These grays are way too dark. What is going on with all of these random boxes?

My face was composed, but my brain began short circuiting immediately. “You did exactly what she said!” it wails as I nod and ask clarifying questions. “There’s nothing for me to pay attention to anyway” it pouts as I decide which shade of grey best compliments Arial as a second level headline. “OMG ur soooo creative” it quips when I make a button turn three shades lighter upon rollover.

## Design is a craft.
Craft is a word that is thrown about pretty lightly in a post-industrial age. I watched the documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” for the first time a few months ago, and remained slack jawed for the majority of the movie as he did things such as describing his witheringly detailed technique for compressing rice into a cube. One of his apprentices worked for 4 years on making egg sushi (a type of panfried cake) before he made even one that was ok enough to not get him yelled at. (Note: It wasn’t good, it just wasn’t so bad that he deserved to be yelled at.) I have absolutely no concept of this sort of tenacity, of this level of focus on the mundane and the familiar. I’m striving towards it by focusing on those small things that I can only notice with absolute familiarity.

This is the part of the story where I, the now educated millennial, talk down to you in the afterglow of this amazing experience, subtly intoning that I now am an amazing designer who’s ready to go out into the world and conquer its design problems.

I can’t do that. I still suck. I still have an incredible amount to learn, even in grey boxes and in Arial. However, I’m starting to see the change. I now receive approving nods on my work, and the content is free come to the fore, leaving time to focus on the logic and flow of the website instead of on my stilted type choices. I’ve begun sketching things on my own, falling into the rhythm of information architecture and asking for help when I can’t make it gel. I can knock out a reasonably balanced headline system in 15 minutes with my eyes half closed and my cone cells dormant.

Perhaps in another 5 months, I’ll be ready to branch out to Arial Narrow. Until then, I’ll keep working on being bored.
