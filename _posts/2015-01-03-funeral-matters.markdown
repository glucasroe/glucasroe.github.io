The death of a loved one is one of the hardest things to cope with. Funerals have a tendency to make a difficult time seem impossible. A sea of potential costs crash into a mountain of protective legislation, and the result is an impenetrable fog of confusion.

New Jersey State Funeral Directors Association (NJSFDA) reached out to us at r2i for strategic and technical help to develop their new product, Funeral Matters. While they already had a paper form process, they wanted an application for both funeral directors and consumers to help them navigate the complex waters of funeral planning with ease and simplicity.

## Translation:

NJSFDA already had a rigorous and well tested product for Funeral Matters, a set of well design paper forms in a packet. Our first phase of the product was to convert these forms into their digital counterparts.

We aimed to streamline the process as much as possible by simplifying complex sections and creating specific interfaces for the different steps.

## Fidelity:

While NJSFDA was going through the process of developing this product, they also needed a way to test it with their members. This testing also served as a proof of concept to get early backing from their members.

Consequently, our Axure prototypes had to be some of the highest fidelity prototypes that we've ever produced. The level of detail included making fully functioning menus, navigation, and even passing in variables to determine conditional logic in the user flow.

#### A more complex example, showing how the mileage calculation was based off of the number of vehicles that were added in the preceding section.

## Diagramming:

Throughout the process, we had numerous rounds of feedback from varying levels of the organization. Initially, the feedback was simple while we had only a few screens of the interface. We quickly found that the conditional logic of the prototype obscured the underlying structure of the system.
After a few rounds of confusion, I created a detailed and annotated flow diagram to show the full process. This document became our key for meetings to guide where work was done, and how it fit in the larger process.

## User Balance:

As we developed these interfaces, we always had a constant concern with our navigation patterns. How could we make an interface that was helpful and verbose for new users (end users who were estimating costs after the death of the loved one) versus expert users (Funeral directors who would use the site numerous times a day.)

One of our main strategies was to create multiple navigation strategies that would guide a new user through the process while allowing the expert user to jump to relevant sections. Our left hand navigation clearly spelled out the main sections and their children. We also added a subtle dot navigation at the top right, giving a small indication of progress and allowing navigation inside of the section. Each section also had navigation buttons that were disabled until the user had selected the relevant information on the screen.

## What didn't work:

The biggest challenge with this project is that we had no exposure to the end users. While one of our clients was testing the product with the end users and reporting his findings, we didn't have any way of knowing how he influenced the tests and if he biased the results in any way.

The level of fidelity also ended up becoming a liability as we got farther along in the project. Because of the depth and complexity of the interactions, the length of time spent editing them grew considerably and adding new workflows became difficult. I've handled this in more recent projects by taking detailed notes and more annotated deliverables, helping us keep track of the complexity over the course of months.

## Overall:

This project was tremendously difficult, and lasted for months (a rarity in the agency world.) The complexities of the industry swirled together with the complexities of the technology, and we spent a lot of time mired in the process and trying to muddle through.

This project exemplifies how UX design is more about the process than the final project. The shiniest prototype that I could produce didn't help us nearly as much as the simple flow chart. The annotations and interface writing became one of the most important parts of my job in this work, superseding my emphasis on the UI and form components we were using.
