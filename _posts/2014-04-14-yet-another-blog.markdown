title: The world doesn't need another blog. (But that isn't stopping me)

It's the age of content, and everyone is publishing so much stuff that nobody can ever have time to read it. I set up a blog and then immediately let it stagnate because I didn't really understand why or what I was planning on writing. Here's why I've decided to start:

##1. Getting in the practice of design thinking
Design thinking takes practice, just like any other skill. Becoming fluent in the thought process of design will take time, effort, and requires me to produce *something*. Documenting my thoughts will cement the type of critical thinking that I need to apply to my work.

##2. An evolving portfolio
As I shift my focus and skills towards UX design, my work is becoming more thought focused and less directly image focused. The posts that I create here will become my portfolio over time.

##3. Continuing to write
I'm still required to write everyday in emails, messages, texts, tweets, and also to verbally communicate to clients and coworkers. The practice of concise and clear communication is lifelong, and I firmly believe that keeping in a habit of writing and reading will help me keep my thoughts well communicated in any media.

##4. Narcissism
I have ideas and thoughts that don't fit on my Twitter profile or in my company blog. Those go here.

So in the coming months, there will be a (hopefully) steady stream of projects, thoughts, a redesign and even some product reviews.
