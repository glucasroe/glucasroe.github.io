I don't go by G, surprisingly.

I'm Lucas, a UX designer and nerd from Maryland.

## <a name="professionally"></a>Professionally:
I try to work as broadly and holistically as possible. I went to school for Design while working as a Front End Developer (in a Marketing department, of all places), and have worked on products in basically every stage of their lifecycle.

I currently work at T. Rowe Price in Owings Mills, as a Senior UX Designer. I have a <a href="/resume">resume</a> that you can read if you'd like.

## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:
I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time cooking, playing piano, practicing calligraphy, reading the whole internet, fixing things, building things, woodworking, DIWhy-ing, playing games, and running all over. I live with my wonderful wife Katie and our daughter Ayla in a highly renovated and extended upon log cabin from the 1800's. Not a joke.

I have a penchant for raw materials, especially cherry wood and leather. Vacations are typically to the mountains or the ocean or a place with rollercoasters. I dance enthusiastically but with questionable ability. I'm really trying to be a morning person, and haven't gotten any closer despite this being in my bio for about five years now.

If you want an earful, ask me at any time what game I'm playing. It's mostly Hearthstone and a smattering of vintage and indy games you likely don't want to hear about.

## <a name="contact"></a> Contact:

I'm available for mentorship requests and general chatting. I'm terrible at Twitter, but you can find me on there [@glucasroe](http://twitter.com/glucasroe)&mdash;although my Tweets are protected now to provide an illusion of decorum. Emails can be sent to `lucas@glucasroe.com`, but be forewarned as my spam filter is efficient and uncaring.
