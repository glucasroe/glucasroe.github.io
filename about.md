I don't go by G, surprisingly.

I'm Lucas, a UX designer and generally nerdy gent from Baltimore.

<aside>This is what my face looks like. The goofy look is because I was having a hard time pushing the shutter button on my camera with a paintbrush handle. My wife told me it's endearing.</aside>

## <a name="professionally"></a>Professionally:
I try to be as broad as possible. I went to school for Design while working as a Front End Developer, and jumped into UX directly after graduating.

I currently work at Fastspot in Hampden, which is literally my favorite company in Baltimore, so I'm pretty happy. (Sorry recruiters, this means I'm not looking for work.)

## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:
I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time cooking, playing piano, practicing calligraphy, reading the whole internet, fixing things, building things, playing games, and forming strong opinions. I live with my wonderful wife Katie, our daughter Ayla, and a trio of pet rats named Ellie, Monk, and Mulder *(Yes, rats. They're wonderful. Yes, the tails are gross. No, I don't want to touch a city rat.)*

I have a penchant for raw materials, especially cherry wood. Vacations are typically to the mountains or the ocean or a place with rollercoasters. I dance enthusiastically but with questionable ability. I'm really trying to be a morning person.

Also, if you want an earful, ask me at any time what game I'm playing. I'll probably have a spreadsheet to show you. (Right now it's (Still!) Hearthstone and also a Minecraft server I run for my nephew)

## <a name="contact"></a> Contact:

I'm available for mentorship requests and general chatting. I'm terrible at Twitter, but you can find me on there [@glucasroe](twitter.com/glucasroe). Emails can be sent to `lucas@this domain`. Sorry about the dumb email masking, but the spam is getting nuts. Love letters are inadvisable.
