I don't go by G, surprisingly.

I'm Lucas, a UX designer and nerd from Baltimore.

## <a name="professionally"></a>Professionally:
I try to be as broad as possible. I went to school for Design while working as a Front End Developer, and jumped into UX directly after graduating.

I currently work at Fastspot in Hampden, which is literally my favorite company in Baltimore, so I'm pretty happy. (Sorry recruiters, this means I'm not looking for work.) However, I also have a <a href="/resume">resume</a> that you can read if you'd like.

## <a name="personally"></a>Personally:
I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time cooking, playing piano, practicing calligraphy, reading the whole internet, fixing things, building things, woodworking, playing games, and running all over. I live with my wonderful wife Katie, and our daughter Ayla in a log cabin circa the 1800's. Not a joke.

I have a penchant for raw materials, especially cherry wood and leather. Vacations are typically to the mountains or the ocean or a place with rollercoasters. I dance enthusiastically but with questionable ability. I'm really trying to be a morning person.

Also, if you want an earful, ask me at any time what game I'm playing. It's mostly Hearthstone and a smattering of vintage and indy games you don't want to hear about.

## <a name="contact"></a> Contact:

I'm available for mentorship requests and general chatting. I'm terrible at Twitter, but you can find me on there [@glucasroe](http://twitter.com/glucasroe)&mdash;although calling it professional would be a stretch. Emails can be sent to `lucas@glucasroe.com`, but be forewarned as my spam filter is effecient and uncaring.
