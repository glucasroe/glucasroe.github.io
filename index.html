<p>I&#8217;m Lucas Roe (I also go by Luck). I am a product design leader. I use a broad range of methodologies to find the path to deliver excellent products.</p>

<h2 id="uncoveringstrategy:">Uncovering strategy:</h2>

<p>My background is in User Experience Design, which deeply informs how I engage. I use a human centric set of tools and methods to bridge gaps between end users and team responsible for the product. My <a href="/resume">experience</a> is comprised of design roles with a growing focus on product direction, strategy, and validation.</p>

<h3 id="humancenteredresearch">Human centered research</h3>

<p>I conduct structured conversations that build understanding of user&rsquo;s true needs, tasks, and environments. I create programs to activate the current customer base to prioritize needs, solve individual problems, and build retention.</p>

<h3 id="engagementandcommunications">Engagement and communications</h3>

<p>Excellent products are made with shared vision. I use internal communications, presentations, and workshops to vet our concepts and build consensus on our execution strategy.</p>

<h3 id="quantitativedata">Quantitative data</h3>

<p>Marrying together quantitative signals with qualitative framing allows us to size effects and verify critical needs. I collect, structure, and humanize data to make it actionable and useful instead of merely pulling metrics.</p>

<h3 id="workcycles">Work cycles</h3>

<p>Large products don&#8217;t often get the luxury of building out the full feature set we want for each release. I find solutions that work in layers, achieving MVP while preparing for future improvements.</p>

<h2 id="anamepersonallyapersonally:"><a name="personally"></a>Personally:</h2>

<p>I have a revolving door of obsessions, so I spend a lot of time reading the whole internet, playing music, creating, fixing things, building things, DIWhy-ing, playing games, and running all over. My wife and I live with our two daughters and a rabbit named Poptart in the woods of central Maryland.</p>
