# OH NOES YOU BROKE IT

Sorry, this page doesn&rsquo;t exist. I can think of a few reasons why this might be so:

1. You&rsquo;re dumb and did something wrong (Improbable)
2. I&rsquo;m dumb and did something wrong (Probable)
3. Computers are wrong and did something dumb (Likely, let&rsquo;s blame them)
4. The universe is cold and unfeeling and does&rsquo;t care about broken links (Definite, but probably not the reason)

By way of a solution, you can go [home](http://glucasroe.com) or you can tweet at me grumpily [@glucasroe](http://twitter.com/glucasroe).

Happy trails!
