I tend to be... esoteric in my computing environment, and use a lot of tools in various different ways. here I will talk about some of them:

## potential tools
I'm not actually using these right now, but this is a night spot to throw things that might someday be useful:
- [novelcrafter](https://www.novelcrafter.com/): I want to write and share drafts with people without having to resort to google docs time and again. I don't think this is the *right* way to do it but it is interesting.
- [yabai window tiling manager](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai?tab=readme-ov-file): lots of big 'ol nerds like me love tiling managers. I'm not sure I would, but I keep this around just in case I decide to start trying it.
- [spline](https://spline.design/): I've had a fascination with 3d tools but haven't ever really gotten to the point of fluency.
