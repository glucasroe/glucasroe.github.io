# the beginning of a garden 🌱

I miss writing in public. I miss feeling like I'm sharing thoughts with the world. And while I do not expect that this will be seen by many, or delude myself into thinking I'm doing much more than stuffing some words into a scraper, I wanted to try. 

## How it works

This garden is built with [Astro](https://astro.build) with help from Claude and supports:

- **Wikilinks**: Use `[[Note Name]]` to link to other notes
- **Tags**: Organize content by topic
- **Timestamps**: Track when notes are created and updated

*This note was planted on {frontmatter.created} and last tended on {frontmatter.updated}.*
